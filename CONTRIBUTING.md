Contributing
============
If you'd like to contribute back to any of the SSE's governing documents, tough luck. Since the SSE does have an internal process (ShadowyCabalReviewStrategy.js) for handling changes
to these documents, we will review your changes and they *may* be merged back
into our "official" documents.
